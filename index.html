          <p>
            Git’s distributed nature means that every developer working on a project has a complete copy of the
            repository, including the full history of changes. This ensures that even if the central server is down,
            developers can still commit and save their work locally. Unlike centralized systems, Git provides unmatched
            reliability and performance for modern software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, Git allows developers to experiment with confidence. By creating branches, developers can test
            new features or fix bugs without interfering with the main project. When the changes are complete and
            verified, they can be seamlessly merged back into the main branch, preserving a clean project history.
          </p>
          <p>Key Benefits of Git:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enables collaborative coding by managing multiple contributors.</li>
            <li>Tracks every change, making it easier to revert or inspect code modifications.</li>
            <li>Provides powerful branching and merging features for parallel development.</li>
            <li>Works offline, meaning you can manage your local repository without internet access.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Common Use Cases:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Keeping a history of code changes.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with a team on the same project.</li>
            <li>Ensuring code stability by isolating new features on separate branches.</li>
          </ol>

        <header>Setting Up a Repository</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Setting up a repository marks the first step in establishing version control for your project. By
            initializing a repository with <code>git init</code>, Git starts tracking the project, creating a
            <code>.git</code> folder that contains the entire history of the project and its configurations. Linking
            this local repository to a remote one ensures that your work is backed up and accessible to collaborators.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to creating a repository, you can configure basic settings like the user name and email, which
            are associated with your commits. This information is crucial for collaboration, as it identifies the
            contributor of each change. To make sure your work is in sync with others, regularly pull updates from the
            remote repository.
          </p>

          <p>Steps to Set Up a Repository:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Install Git on your machine.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.</li>
            <li>Run the command git init to initialize the repository.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Once initialized, you can begin tracking your project files. If you’re using a remote service like GitHub,
            you can link the repository to push your changes to the cloud. Sample Commands:

            <code>
              <br />
              git init <br />
              git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git <br />
              git pull origin main
            </code>

            The process of staging changes allows developers to carefully review what will be included in a commit. This
            step prevents unnecessary files or mistakes from being added to the project history. Git’s ability to commit
            only staged changes ensures that developers maintain a clean and meaningful history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pushing commits to a remote repository is crucial for collaboration. It allows others to access your changes
            and ensures that your progress is safely backed up. By regularly adding, committing, and pushing changes,
            developers can work efficiently, knowing their contributions are documented and shared.
          </p>

          <p>Git operates on a three-step process for managing changes: staging, committing, and pushing.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Staging: Files must be added to the staging area using <code>git add</code>.</li>
            <li>Committing: Record the changes in the repository using <code>git commit</code>.</li>
            <li>Pushing: Upload the changes to a remote repository using <code>git push</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Sample Commands:
            <br />
            <code>
              git add file.txt <br />
              git commit -m "Add file.txt" <br />
              git push origin main
            </code>

        <article>
          <p>
            Branching empowers teams to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously without conflict. For example,
            while one developer is working on a new feature, another can fix a bug in the <code>main</code> branch. Git
            makes it easy to manage these parallel developments and integrate them once complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Merging, however, can sometimes lead to conflicts when changes overlap. Git provides powerful tools to
            resolve these conflicts, ensuring that the final code integrates smoothly. By practicing good branch
            management, such as naming conventions and frequent updates from the main branch, teams can minimize
            potential issues.
          </p>

          <p>Key Concepts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A branch is a pointer to a specific commit.</li>
            <li>The <code>main</code> branch is the default branch in most projects.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Steps to Create and Merge a Branch:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a branch using <code>git branch feature-name</code>.</li>
            <li>
              Switch to the branch with <code>git checkout feature-name</code> or <code>git switch feature-name</code>.
            </li>
            <li>Merge it back to <code>main</code> with <code>git merge feature-name</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Sample Commands:
            <code>
              <br />
              git branch feature <br />
              git checkout feature <br />
              git merge feature
            </code>

        <header>Pull Requests and Collaboration</header>

        <article>
          <p>
            Pull requests facilitate a structured review process where contributors can propose changes, and
            collaborators can provide feedback. This process ensures that every change meets the project’s standards and
            fits seamlessly into the existing codebase. Tools like GitHub make this process even more efficient with
            inline comments and automated checks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Collaboration in Git encourages transparency and accountability. Each commit is tied to a specific
            contributor, making it easy to identify who made changes and why. With a clear history of modifications,
            team members can build trust and improve the quality of their projects.
          </p>

          <p>Steps in the Pull Request Process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Push your changes to a feature branch in the remote repository.</li>
            <li>Open a pull request on the GitHub repository.</li>
            <li>Reviewers comment on your code and suggest changes.</li>
            <li>Once approved, merge the pull request into the main branch.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Collaboration Tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regularly pull changes from the main branch to stay up-to-date.</li>
            <li>Use descriptive commit messages to explain your changes.</li>
